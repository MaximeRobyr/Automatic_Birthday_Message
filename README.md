# 1. README
Have you ever forgotten to wish a friend or family member a birthday? Now, thanks to Automatic_Birthday_Message, that will never happen again. If you upload the birth dates of all your friends to an Excel spreadsheet, our code will automatically send the birthday message for you via WhatsApp. You will never have to remember your relatives' birthdays again, our programme does it for you. First of all, before running our code, you need to manually enter the data on an Excel sheet. You need to add the person's name, phone number and date of birth. You can add as many people as you wish, even if several of them are born on the same day. Then, you can run the code and it will automatically send the message.
